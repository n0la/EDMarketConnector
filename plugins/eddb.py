"""Station display and eddb.io lookup."""
# Tests:
#
# As there's a lot of state tracking in here, need to ensure (at least)
# the URL text and link follow along correctly with:
#
#  1) Game not running, EDMC started.
#  2) Then hit 'Update' for CAPI data pull
#  3) Login fully to game, and whether #2 happened or not:
#      a) If docked then update Station
#      b) Either way update System
#  4) Undock, SupercruiseEntry, FSDJump should change Station text to 'x'
#    and link to system one.
#  5) RequestDocking should populate Station, no matter if the request
#    succeeded or not.
#  6) FSDJump should update System text+link.
#  7) Switching to a different provider and then back... combined with
#    any of the above in the interim.

# This is an EDMC 'core' plugin.
#
# All EDMC plugins are *dynamically* loaded at run-time.
#
# We build for Windows using `py2exe`.
#
# `py2exe` can't possibly know about anything in the dynamically loaded
# core plugins.
#
# Thus you **MUST** check if any imports you add in this file are only
# referenced in this file (or only in any other core plugin), and if so...
#
#     YOU MUST ENSURE THAT PERTINENT ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE IN
#     `Build-exe-and-msi.py` SO AS TO ENSURE THE FILES ARE ACTUALLY PRESENT IN
#     AN END-USER INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS.
