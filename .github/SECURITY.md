# Reporting Security Issues

EDMC takes security very seriously. Our users trust us to provide a secure and safe tool to support their experience in Elite.

In general, the best way to report a major security issue with us that should not be publically discussed is to email our maintainer teams. 

The best point of contact for this is edmc@hullseals.space. When contacting, be sure to include as much information in your report. 

As soon as your report is processed, we'll get in touch to make sure we quickly move ahead with fixing the issue and will lay out a timeline for public disclosure and fixes.

Another method of reporting vulnerabilities is to open a new Bug Report [here](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2C+unconfirmed&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=).

If reporting a security issue here, do not include details as to the issue or steps to reproduce, simply indicate you have found a potential security bug and would like us to contact you directly.
